# stopScrolling()

## Overview 
An Android mobile app developed to inhibit mindless scrolling and cultivate better habits by redirecting attention to more productive and desired activities.

## Story
With the widespread popularity of apps like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, a significant portion of the youth population spends their time mindlessly consuming content. Falling into the trap of doom-scrolling is a considerable time-waster, especially when more productive or enjoyable activities are available. 

When faced with this challenge, I searched the app store for a solution, only to find that many were behind a paywall. That's when I took the initiative to develop stopScrolling(), an app designed to block certain applications after a designated period, encouraging users to redirect their time toward more meaningful pursuits.

## Architecture
This project is exclusively written in Java.

stopScrolling() is implemented following the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture pattern.

The project uses XML for UI, and Shared Preferences for data persistence.
